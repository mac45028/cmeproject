# cmeproject

Goals:

The goal of this project is to calculate the American style option pricing based on Whaley model.

The sample data will be prepared by the pc size and then send them all to FPGA to calculate the option

in batch. 

Result:

The algorithm can price the option correctly as designed and the performance is around ~800 contacts per second.
